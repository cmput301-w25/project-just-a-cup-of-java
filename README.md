## Project Description

Team Just a Cup of Java presents a mood tracking application designed to help users monitor and reflect on their emotional states over time. Built as an Android app using Java and Firebase, the app allows users to log mood events with details like emotional state, triggers, social situations, and photos. Users can view their mood history, filter it by various criteria, follow friends' moods, and manage their profile. The app supports offline functionality with synchronization and provides a calendar view for selecting dates to log or review moods.

## Key Features

- Mood Logging and Editing: Users can add, edit, and delete mood events, including details like emotional state (e.g., happiness, sadness), triggers, social situations, and optional photos (US 01.01.01 - US 02.04.01).
- Mood History and Filtering: View a list of past mood events sorted by date, with filtering options for recent weeks, emotional states, and reason keywords (US 04.01.01 - US 04.04.01).
- Social Features and Profile Management: Follow friendsâ€™ moods, grant follow permissions, and manage user profiles with unique usernames and bios (US 03.01.01, US 05.01.01 - US 05.06.01).

1. Clone the Repository: Clone the project from the GitHub repository using git clone <repository-url> in your terminal.
2. Set Up Firebase: Create a Firebase project, enable Firestore and Authentication, and add your google-services.json file to the app directory.
